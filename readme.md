#IO Lab: Lecture 3

##Instructions

###Setup
1. Clone this repository to your computer.
2. Open the "main.css" file in your text editor. Make a copy of this file and name it with your first and last name (eg, jsmith.css)
3. Open the file "index.html". Make a copy of this file and save it with your first initial and last name (e.g. jsmith.html)
4. Inside the html file you just created, locate the &lt;style&gt; tag pointing to "main.css". Change the file name to your css file.
5. Commit your changes.

###Practice with CSS
6. Open the html file in a browser. It contains the content of a typical blog page, but it doesn't look like much because there are no styles.
7. Open the "result.pdf" file. This is (roughly) what the page should look like when you are finished with the lab.
8. Edit the css file according to the numbered instructions in the comments above each selector. For students who have intermediate ability with CSS, you should also complete the tasks marked 'advanced'. For those of you who are up for a challenge, delete the contents of the starter css file and try to recreate the look of the "results.pdf" page from scratch :)

###Swap with a Partner
9. When you are finished with the lab, push your changes to github.
10. Find a partner who is also finished.
11. Pull the repository and open your partner's html file.
12. Add some additional tags to the tag cloud.
13. Commit your changes, then push back to Github.
